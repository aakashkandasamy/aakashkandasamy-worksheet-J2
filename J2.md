1. Object vs. Basic Type
- int a;: Basic type 
- double b;: Basic type 
- int c[] = {1, 2, 3};: Object
- String s = "Hello World";: Object 

2. Two-part Question

(A) What is a static method in Java?

A static method belongs to the class, not an instance of the class. It can be called without creating an object of the class. Static methods can only access static variables and other static methods directly. 

(B) Why does the main method need to be a static method?

The main method needs to be static because it is the entry point of the program. When the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) starts the program, it does not have any object of the class created yet, so the method must be static to allow the JVM to invoke it without needing to instantiate the class.

3. Program Outputs

Program 1: Wrong

Program 2: Correct
 
4. In Java, method parameters are passed by value, which means the method receives a copy of the reference to the object. Inside the change_season method, the local copy of the str reference is modified, but it does not affect the original season variable in the main method. Therefore, season remains "Winter".

5. X: 0.0 Y: 0.0

The assignment inside the constructor does not modify the instance variables of the Point object. We would need to use this.x = x; and this.y = y; to refer to the instance variables.

6. The principle of Encapsulation is achieved by using the private keyword for variables and methods. Encapsulation restricts direct access to some of an object's components and prevents unauthorized parties from accessing or modifying them. 

7. When we create a new Point object, Java decides which constructor to use based on the arguments passed to the constructor. 

8. Option 4 works because it uses the getX() and getY() methods to retrieve the current values and setXY() to update them. 

9. This code will not compile because calling super(0 ,0) must be the first statement in any constructor. We cannot call setXY(10, 10) before super(0, 0).

10. The output will be a CustomPoint object with x = 10 and y = 10. 

11. Option 1 and Option 2 are valid implementations. Options 3 and 4 are invalid because they define a method custom_sum_x_y() instead of overriding sum_x_y(). 

12. The protected modifier allows members to be accessed within the same package or by subclasses, even if those subclasses are in different packages. Subclasses can directly access protected fields and methods from their parent class, making it useful when you want to give access to derived classes but hide them from the rest of the code.

13. 

java
public class FormulaOne extends Racecar {
    private String make;

    public FormulaOne(int number, Driver driver, String make) {
        super(number, driver);
        this.make = make;
    }

    @Override
    public String toString() {
        return super.toString() + " Make: " + make;
    }
}


14. Both mark A and mark B will work because the addSponsor method is protected, meaning it is accessible in the Racecar class and all its subclasses.
